//the mongoose.model method is saying which schema is to be imported by the files.js the first arguement sets the name of the model and the second arguement defines the schema of the model

//the name that we specified File is basically the kind of data type that we made here containing these fields it's like defniing a class here and including this class file in some other js file and then using that class type there for example 'node'.
